Shipping policy
 

1) How long does it take for my Order to get shipped?

All orders are dispatched ASAP from our facility.

Shipping takes 14-21 days (often within 14 days)

 

2) Please allow extra time for your order to be processed during Public Holidays and busy periods. Customs and Postal Service may also require extra time to work on the processing /delivery during peak season or before major festivals (e.g. Valentineâ€™s Day). 

 

3) All orders will typically be dispatched ASAP and all orders will include tracking from dispatch to delivery. All orders will be shipped in durable packaging to ensure your purchase is not damaged during transit. We are not responsible for delays or orders sent to incorrect, invalid addresses. It is always in our best interest to make sure you receive your parcel in a timely manner and we will assist as much as possible to trace a missing parcel. We are not responsible for refunds of shipping costs in the event of delayed shipping due to product availability.

 

4) We are not responsible for any shipping deliveries that may be affected by customs, natural occurrences, or air and ground transportation strikes or delays once the package has exited the Warehouse.

 

5) IMPORT TAXES & DUTIES

Some countries may require import tax, duties and related Customs fees for the imports, and the cost is not covered in payments you made to us. These charges, if applicable, are determined and charged by the Customs office of the destination country. 

Please note that your customs office may delay the arrival of your package. Be sure to contact them if this is the case.
